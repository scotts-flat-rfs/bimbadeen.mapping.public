# The Landscape.
The Bimbadeen ridge runs for 6 km in a southwest to northeast direction, whilst the Lambs Valley ridge runs for 6 km in a north south direction. The ridges rise sharply from 50m elevation to over 400m. 
The north-western slopes of Bimbadeen ridge are predominantly grass covered, with a slopes > 30 degrees. The south-eastern slopes are steep, heavily timbered wet sclerophyll forest, interspersed with vertical cliff faces falling to Stanhope creek.
The western slopes of Lambs Valley ridge rise on a 30 degree gradient to the ridgetop. These are lightly timbered dry grassy woodland interspaced with steep creek lines. The eastern slopes are very steep to vertical and covered with dense wet sclerophyll forest. 
Stanhope Creek drains these two ridges, entering the Hunter River at Stanhope. There are extensive rain forest areas in this area
To the north, the two ridges eventually join on a 440m high open grassland plateau of approximately 1,800 Ha.
In 2012 a HotSpots Fire Project was undertaken, including a detailed vegetation and threatened species review. Average annual rainfall over the last 10 years was >1200mm. 

# Access. 
The area is bounded by Lambs Valley Road in the east,
Summerhill and Glendonbrook roads to the north, Cranky Corner Road to the west (not fully sealed, gates, 4WD only) and Stanhope Road to the South.
Bimbadeen Road runs off Cranky Corner Road (South end), rising up a 26 degree slope to the ridgetop. Singleton Council maintains the first 3.5 km of the 9km road. There are two branches of Bimbadeen Road. Forest Glade leads to the north, and Fig Tree Rise leads to the southwest, the latter crossing Stanhope Creek and terminating near the top of Lambs Valley ridge. Both branch roads are dead ends. 

The residents on the Lambs Valley ridge line are accessed from Lambs Valley Road, up a 26 degree single lane no passing incline to the ridgetop. From the ridgetop, the road is unsealed. The last resident on this road is 5 km from Lambs Valley Road.

*NB*Only one road in, the same road out.*
